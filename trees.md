### Height and Depth of a Binary tree

Height: The height of a binary tree is the number of edges along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. 

Depth: The depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

An empty tree has a height of -1
A tree with only one node (root node) has a height of 0
